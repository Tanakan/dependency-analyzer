# Testing the D3.js Visualization Fix

## Issue
The D3.js graph visualization was not showing links correctly for duplicate projects (e.g., multiple config-service nodes). The links appeared in the JSON data but were not rendered in the visualization.

## Root Cause
D3.js's forceLink() mutates the original links array by replacing string source/target IDs with object references. Since the simulation was being stopped immediately but sometimes restarted later, this caused inconsistent behavior where:
1. The original data.links array was mutated
2. Link rendering code expected string IDs but sometimes got object references
3. This resulted in links not being displayed correctly

## Fix Applied
1. **Clone links for simulation**: Created a separate array for the simulation to prevent mutation of the original data
2. **Handle both ID types in tick handler**: Updated the simulation tick handler to handle both string IDs and object references

## Changes Made

### In `/src/main/resources/static/index.html`:

1. Before creating the force simulation (around line 975):
```javascript
// Clone links to prevent D3 from mutating the original data
const simulationLinks = data.links.map(link => ({
    source: link.source,
    target: link.target,
    value: link.value
}));

// Create force simulation but don't start it
simulation = d3.forceSimulation(data.nodes)
    .force("link", d3.forceLink(simulationLinks).id(d => d.id)
    // ... rest of the simulation setup
```

2. In the simulation tick handler (around line 1138):
```javascript
// Handle both object references and string IDs
const sourceNode = typeof d.source === 'object' ? d.source : data.nodes.find(n => n.id === d.source);
const targetNode = typeof d.target === 'object' ? d.target : data.nodes.find(n => n.id === d.target);
```

## Testing Steps
1. Run the dependency analyzer CLI to generate a new JSON file with duplicate projects
2. Start the Spring Boot application
3. Open http://localhost:3030 in a browser
4. Verify that:
   - All links are displayed correctly
   - Links to duplicate projects (like config-service) are visible
   - The graph shows proper connections between nodes
   - Clicking on nodes highlights the correct dependency paths

## Expected Result
The visualization should now correctly display all links, including those connecting to duplicate project nodes.
